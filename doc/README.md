### About Flame

Flame is a modular, Flutter-Game-Engine, that provides a complete set of out-of-the-way solutions for games.
Flame takes the powerful infrastructure provided by Flutter and simplifies it to fit your needs in building your very own game.

Flame is built with a simple, yet effective, game loop implementation with the necessary functionalities that you might need in your game development.
<!-- Here are some of the functionalities that're already built-into Flame for you to use:
[Input](gesture-input) /
[Images](images#images) /
[Sprites](images#sprite) /
[Sprite-Sheets](images#spritesheet) /
[Animations](images#animation) /
[Collision-Detection](collision_detection) -->

### Built For More

Not satisfied with what Flame has to offer? we got you!<br>
Flame is a highly modular engine that is built with a component system that we call `Flame Component System` (or `FCS` for short).
Using the `FCS` you can extend and create new functionalities that complement YOUR-GAME, or even better, make your life easier by creating components that match your game style and theme for better maintainability and scalability of your game.

### The Flame Eco-System

Flame works with stand-alone packages that extend the Flame-Engine functionalities even more, you can pick and choose whichever parts you want, as they are all independent and modular.
- [pub/flame_audio](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_audio)
Adds audio capabilities using the [pub/audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers) package.
- [pub/flame_forge2d](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_forge2d)
Adds physics capabilities using our own [pub/box2d](https://pub.dev/packages/box2d) port called [pub/forge2d](https://pub.dev/packages/forge2d).
- [pub/flame_tiled](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_tiled)
Adds integration with our [pub/tiled](https://pub.dev/packages/tiled) library.
